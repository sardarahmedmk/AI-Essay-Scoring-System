# 🚀 Essay Scoring System - Architecture Update

## ✅ COMPLETED: Separation of CSS and JavaScript Files

### Problem Solved
The main page was experiencing CSS syntax errors because all styles and scripts were embedded directly in the HTML file. This caused compilation errors and prevented the enhanced features from displaying properly.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Created separate files:**
   - `templates/styles.css` - All styling with glass-morphism effects and responsive design
   - `templates/script.js` - All JavaScript functionality including AI features
   - `templates/mainpage.html` - Clean HTML structure with external file references

2. **Updated Flask server:**
   - Added static file serving capability for CSS and JS files
   - Modified `site_optimized.py` to handle requests to `/styles.css` and `/script.js`

### Files Created/Modified
- ✅ `templates/styles.css` - Complete CSS with advanced styling
- ✅ `templates/script.js` - Full JavaScript functionality
- ✅ `templates/mainpage.html` - Clean HTML structure
- ✅ `site_optimized.py` - Added static file serving
